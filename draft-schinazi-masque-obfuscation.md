--- abstract

This document describes MASQUE Obfuscation. MASQUE Obfuscation is a mechanism
that allows co-locating and obfuscating networking applications behind an
HTTPS web server. The currently prevalent use-case is to allow running a proxy
or VPN server that is indistinguishable from an HTTPS server to any
unauthenticated observer. We do not expect major providers and CDNs to deploy
this behind their main TLS certificate, as they are not willing to take the
risk of getting blocked, as shown when domain fronting was blocked. An
expected use would be for individuals to enable this behind their personal
websites via easy to configure open-source software.

This document is a straw-man proposal. It does not contain enough details to
implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark discussions on
the approach it is taking. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on
the MASQUE IETF mailing list <masque@ietf.org> or on the GitHub repository
which contains the draft: <https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts>.

# Introduction {#introduction}

This document describes MASQUE Obfuscation. MASQUE Obfuscation is a mechanism
that allows co-locating and obfuscating networking applications behind an
HTTPS web server. The currently prevalent use-case is to allow running a proxy
or VPN server that is indistinguishable from an HTTPS server to any
unauthenticated observer. We do not expect major providers and CDNs to deploy
this behind their main TLS certificate, as they are not willing to take the
risk of getting blocked, as shown when domain fronting was blocked. An
expected use would be for individuals to enable this behind their personal
websites via easy to configure open-source software.

This document is a straw-man proposal. It does not contain enough details to
implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark discussions on
the approach it is taking. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on
the MASQUE IETF mailing list <masque@ietf.org> or on the GitHub repository
which contains the draft: <https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts>.

MASQUE Obfuscation is built upon the MASQUE protocol
{{!MASQUE=I-D.schinazi-masque}}. MASQUE Obfuscation leverages the efficient
head-of-line blocking prevention features of the QUIC transport protocol
{{!QUIC=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} when MASQUE Obfuscation is used in an HTTP/3
{{!HTTP3=I-D.ietf-quic-http}} server. MASQUE Obfuscation can also run in an
HTTP/2 server {{!HTTP2=RFC7540}} but at a performance cost.


## Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# Usage Scenarios {#usage-scenarios}

There are currently multiple usage scenarios that can benefit from MASQUE
Obfuscation.


## Protection from Network Providers {#protection-providers}

Some users may wish to obfuscate the destination of their network traffic from
their network provider. This prevents network providers from using data
harvested from this network traffic in ways the user did not intend.


## Protection from Web Servers {#protection-servers}

There are many clients who would rather not establish a direct connection to
web servers, for example to avoid location tracking. The clients can do that
by running their traffic through a MASQUE Obfuscation server. The web server
will only see the IP address of the MASQUE Obfuscation server, not that of the
client.


## Onion Routing {#onion}

Routing traffic through a MASQUE Obfuscation server only provides partial
protection against tracking, because the MASQUE Obfuscation server knows the
address of the client. Onion routing as it exists today mitigates this issue
for TCP/TLS. A MASQUE Obfuscation server could allow onion routing over QUIC.

In this scenario, the client establishes a connection to the MASQUE
Obfuscation server, then through that to another MASQUE Obfuscation server,
etc. This creates a tree of MASQUE servers rooted at the client. QUIC
connections are mapped to a specific branch of the tree. The first MASQUE
Obfuscation server knows the actual address of the client, but the other
MASQUE Obfuscation servers only know the address of the previous server.
To assure reasonable privacy, the path should include at least 3 MASQUE
Obfuscation servers.


# Requirements {#requirements}

This section describes the goals and requirements chosen for MASQUE
Obfuscation.


## Invisibility of Usage {#invisibility-usage}

An authenticated client using MASQUE Obfuscation appears to observers as a
regular HTTPS client. Observers only see that HTTP/3 or HTTP/2 is being used
over an encrypted channel. No part of the exchanges between client and server
may stick out. Note that traffic analysis is discussed in {{traffic-analysis}}.


## Invisibility of the Server {#invisibility-server}

To anyone without private keys, the server is indistinguishable from a regular
web server. It is impossible to send an unauthenticated probe that the server
would reply to differently than if it were a normal web server.


## Fallback to HTTP/2 over TLS over TCP {#fallback-h2}

When QUIC is blocked, MASQUE Obfuscation can run over TCP and still satisfy
previous requirements. Note that in this scenario performance may be
negatively impacted.


# Overview of the Mechanism {#overview}

The server runs an HTTPS server on port 443, and has a valid TLS certificate
for its domain. The client has a public/private key pair, and the server
maintains a list of authorized MASQUE Obfuscation clients, and their public
key. (Alternatively, clients can also be authenticated using a shared secret.)
The client starts by establishing a regular HTTPS connection to the server
(HTTP/3 over QUIC or HTTP/2 over TLS 1.3 {{!TLS13=RFC8446}} over TCP), and
validates the server's TLS certificate as it normally would for HTTPS. If
validation fails, the connection is aborted. At this point the client can send
regular unauthenticated HTTP requests to the server. When it wishes to start
MASQUE Obfuscation, the client uses HTTP Transport Authentication
{{!TRANSPORT-AUTH=I-D.schinazi-httpbis-transport-auth}} to prove its possession
of its associated key. The client sends the Transport-Authentication header
alongside its MASQUE Negotiation request.

When the server receives the MASQUE Negotiation request, it authenticates the
client and if that fails responds with code "404 Not Found", making sure its
response is the same as what it would return for any unexpected POST
request. If authentication succeeds, the server sends its list of supported
MASQUE applications and the client can start using them.


# Connection Resumption {#resumption}

Clients MUST NOT attempt to "resume" MASQUE Obfuscation state similarly to how
TLS sessions can be resumed. Every new QUIC or TLS connection requires fully
authenticating the client and server. QUIC 0-RTT and TLS early data MUST
NOT be used with MASQUE Obfuscation as they are not forward secure.


# Path MTU Discovery {#pmtud}

In the main deployment of this mechanism, QUIC will be used between client
and server, and that will most likely be the smallest MTU link in the path
due to QUIC header and authentication tag overhead. The client is responsible
for not sending overly large UDP packets and notifying the server of the low
MTU. Therefore PMTUD is currently seen as out of scope of this document.


# Operation over HTTP/2 {#http2}

We will need to define the details of how to run MASQUE over HTTP/2.
When running over HTTP/2, MASQUE uses the Extended CONNECT method to negotiate
the use of datagrams over an HTTP/2 stream
{{!HTTP2-TRANSPORT=I-D.kinnear-httpbis-http2-transport}}.

MASQUE Obfuscation implementations SHOULD discover that HTTP/3 is available
(as opposed to only HTTP/2) using the same mechanism as regular HTTP traffic.
This current standardized mechanism for this is HTTP Alternative Services
{{!ALT-SVC=RFC7838}}, but future mechanisms such as
{{?HTTPSSVC=I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc}} can be used if they become
widespread.

MASQUE Obfuscation implementations using HTTP/3 MUST support the fallback to
HTTP/2 to avoid incentivizing censors to block HTTP/3 or QUIC.

When the client wishes to use the "UDP Proxying" MASQUE application over
HTTP/2, the client opens a new stream with a CONNECT request to the
"masque-udp-proxy" protocol and then sends datagrams encapsulated inside the
stream with a two-byte length prefix in network byte order. The target IP and
port are sent as part of the URL query. Resetting that stream instructs the
server to release any associated resources.

When the client wishes to use the "IP Proxying" MASQUE application over
HTTP/2, the client opens a new stream with a CONNECT request to the
"masque-ip-proxy" protocol and then sends IP datagrams with a two byte length
prefix. The server can inspect the IP datagram to look for the destination
address in the IP header.


# Security Considerations {#security}

Here be dragons. TODO: slay the dragons.

## Traffic Analysis {#traffic-analysis}

While MASQUE Obfuscation ensures that proxied traffic appears similar to
regular HTTP traffic, it doesn't inherently defeat traffic analysis. However,
the fact that MASQUE leverages QUIC allows it to segment STREAM frames over
multiple packets and add PADDING frames to change the observable
characteristics of its encrypted traffic. The exact details of how to change
traffic patterns to defeat traffic analysis is considered an open research
question and is out of scope for this document.

When multiple MASQUE Obfuscation servers are available, a client can leverage
QUIC connection migration to seamlessly transition its end-to-end QUIC
connections by treating separate MASQUE Obfuscation servers as different paths.
This could afford an additional level of obfuscation in hopes of rendering
traffic analysis less effective.


## Untrusted Servers {#untrusted-servers}

As with any proxy or VPN technology, MASQUE Obfuscation hides some of the
client's private information (such as who they are communicating with) from
their network provider by transferring that information to the MASQUE server.
It is paramount that clients only use MASQUE Obfuscation servers that they
trust, as a malicious actor could easily setup a MASQUE Obfuscation server and
advertise it as a privacy solution in hopes of attracting users to send it
their traffic.


# IANA Considerations {#iana}

We will need to register the "masque-udp-proxy" and "masque-ip-proxy" extended
HTTP CONNECT protocols.

# Design Justifications {#design}
{:numbered="false"}

Using an exported key as a nonce allows us to prevent replay attacks (since it
depends on randomness from both endpoints of the TLS connection) without
requiring the server to send an explicit nonce before it has authenticated the
client. Adding an explicit nonce mechanism would expose the server as it would
need to send these nonces to clients that have not been authenticated yet.

The rationale for a separate MASQUE protocol stream is to allow
server-initiated messages. If we were to use HTTP semantics, we would only be
able to support the client-initiated request-response model. We could have used
WebSocket for this purpose but that would have added wire overhead and
dependencies without providing useful features.

There are many other ways to authenticate HTTP, however the authentication
used here needs to work in a single client-initiated message to meet the
requirement of not exposing the server.

The current proposal would also work with TLS 1.2, but in that case TLS false
start and renegotiation must be disabled, and the extended master secret and
renegotiation indication TLS extensions must be enabled.

If the server or client want to hide that HTTP/2 is used, the client can set
its ALPN to an older version of HTTP and then use the Upgrade header to
upgrade to HTTP/2 inside the TLS encryption.

The client authentication used here is similar to how Token
Binding {{?RFC8471}} operates, but it has very different goals. MASQUE does
not use token binding directly because using token binding requires sending
the token_binding TLS extension in the TLS ClientHello, and that would stick
out compared to a regular TLS connection.

TLS post-handshake authentication {{?I-D.sullivan-tls-post-handshake-auth}}
is not used by this proposal because that requires sending the
"post_handshake_auth" extension in the TLS ClientHello, and that would stick
out from a regular HTTPS connection.

Client authentication could have benefited from Secondary Certificate
Authentication in HTTP/2 {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2-secondary-certs}},
however that has two downsides: it requires the server advertising that
it supports it in its SETTINGS, and it cannot be sent unprompted by the
client, so the server would have to request authentication.
Both of these would make the server stick out from regular HTTP/2 servers.

MASQUE proposes a new client authentication method (as opposed to reusing
something like HTTP basic authentication) because HTTP authentication methods
are conceptually per-request (they need to be repeated on each request)
whereas the new method is bound to the underlying connection (be it QUIC or
TLS). In particular, this allows sending QUIC DATAGRAM frames without
authenticating every frame individually. Additionally, HMAC and asymmetric
keying are preferred to sending a password for client authentication since
they have a tighter security bound. Going into the design rationale, HMACs
(and signatures) need some data to sign, and to avoid replay attacks that
should be a fresh nonce provided by the remote peer. Having the server
provide an explicit nonce would leak the existence of the server so we use
TLS keying material exporters as they provide us with a nonce that contains
entropy from the server without requiring explicit communication.
