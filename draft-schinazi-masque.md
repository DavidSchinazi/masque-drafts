--- abstract

This document describes a mechanism that allows co-locating and obfuscating
networking applications behind an HTTPS web server. The currently prevalent
use-case is to allow running a VPN server that is indistinguishable from an
HTTPS server to any unauthenticated observer. We do not expect major providers
and CDNs to deploy this behind their main TLS cert, as they are not willing to
take the risk of going blocked, as shown when domain fronting was blocked. An
expected use would be for individuals to enable this behind their personal
websites via easy to configure open-source software.

This document is a straw-man proposal, everything in it is up for discussion,
especially the name.

# Introduction

TODO Introduction.


# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# Requirements

## Invisibility of Usage

An authenticated client using the VPN appears to observers as a regular HTTPS
client. Observers only see that HTTP/3 or HTTP/2 is being used over an
encrypted channel. No part of the exchanges between client and server may
stick out. Note that traffic analysis is currently considered out of scope.


## Invisibility of Server

To anyone without private keys, the server is indistinguishable from a regular
web server. It is impossible to send an unauthenticated probe that the server
would reply to differently than if it were a normal web server.


## Fallback to HTTP/2 over TLS over TCP

When QUIC is blocked, this mechanism can run over TCP and still satisfy
previous requirements. Note that in this scenario performance may be
negatively impacted.


# Overview of the Mechanism

The server runs an HTTPS server on port 443, and has a valid TLS certificate
for its domain. The client has a public/private key pair, and the server
maintains a list of authorized MASQUE clients, and their public key. The
client starts by establishing a regular HTTPS connection to the server
(HTTP/3 over QUIC or HTTP/2 over TLS 1.3 over TCP), and validates the
server's TLS certificate as it normally would for HTTPS. If validation
fails, the connection is aborted. The client then uses a TLS keying material
exporter with label "EXPORTER-masque" and no context to generate a 32-byte
key. This key is then used as a nonce to prevent replay attacks. The client
then sends an HTTP CONNECT request for "/.well-known/masque/initial" with
the :protocol pseudo-header field set to "masque", and a
"Masque-Authentication:" header. The MASQUE authentication header differs
from the HTTP "Authorization" header in that it applies to the underlying
connection instead of being per-request. It can use either a shared secret
or asymmetric authentication. The asymmetric variant uses authentication
method "PublicKey", and it transmits a signature of the nonce with the
client's public key encoded in base64 format, followed by other information
such as the client username and signature algorithm OID. The symmetric
variant uses authentication method "HMAC" and transmits an HMAC of the
nonce with the shared secret instead of a signature. For example this header
could look like:

~~~
Masque-Authentication: PublicKey u="am9obi5kb2U=";a=1.3.101.112;
s="SW5zZXJ0IHNpZ25hdHVyZSBvZiBub25jZSBoZXJlIHdo
aWNoIHRha2VzIDUxMiBiaXRzIGZvciBFZDI1NTE5IQ=="
Masque-Authentication: HMAC u="am9obi5kb2U=";a=2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.3;
s="SW5zZXJ0IHNpZ25hdHVyZSBvZiBub25jZSBoZXJlIHdo
aWNoIHRha2VzIDUxMiBiaXRzIGZvciBFZDI1NTE5IQ=="
~~~
{: #auth-format title="MASQUE Authentication Format Example"}

When the server receives this CONNECT request, it verifies the signature and
if that fails responds with code "405 Method Not Allowed", making sure its
response is the same as what it would return for any unexpected CONNECT
request. If the signature verifies, the server responds with code
"101 Switching Protocols", and from then on this HTTP stream is now dedicated
to the MASQUE protocol. That protocol provides a reliable bidirectional
message exchange mechanism, which is used by the client and server to
negotiate what protocol options are supported and enabled by policy, and
client VPN configuration such as IP addresses. When using QUIC, this protocol
also allows endpoints to negotiate the use of QUIC extensions, such as support
for the DATAGRAM frame.


# Mechanisms the server can advertise to authenticated clients

## HTTP Proxy

The client can make proxied HTTP requests through the server to other
servers. In practice this will mean using the CONNECT method to establish a
stream over which to run TLS to a different remote destination.


## DNS over HTTPS

The client can send DNS queries using DoH to the MASQUE server.


## UDP Proxying

In order to support WebRTC or QUIC to further servers, clients need a way to
relay UDP onwards to a remote server. In practice for most widely deployed
protocols other than DNS, this involves many datagrams over the same ports.
Therefore this mechanism implements that efficiently: clients can use the
MASQUE protocol stream to request an UDP association to an IP address and
UDP port pair. In QUIC, the server would reply with a DATAGRAM_ID that the
client can then use to have UDP datagrams sent to this remote server.
Datagrams are then simply transferred between the DATAGRAMs with this ID and
the outer server. There will also be a message on the MASQUE protocol stream
to request shutdown of a UDP association to save resources when it is no
longer needed. When running over TCP, the client opens a new stream with a
CONNECT request to the "masque-udp-proxy" protocol and then sends datagrams
encapsulated inside the stream with a two-byte length prefix in network byte
order. The target IP and port are sent as part of the URL query. Resetting
that stream instructs the server to release any associates resources.


## IP Proxying

For the rare cases where the previous mechanisms are not sufficient, proxying
can be performed at the IP layer. This would use a different DATAGRAM_ID and
IP datagrams would be encoded inside it without framing. Over TCP, a dedicated
stream with two byte length prefix would be used. The server can inspect the
IP datagram to look for the destination address in the IP header.


## PMTUD

In the main deployment of this mechanism, QUIC will be used between client
and server, and that will most likely be the smallest MTU link in the path
due to QUIC header and authentication tag overhead. The client is responsible
for not sending overly large UDP packets and notifying the server of the low
MTU. Therefore PMTUD is currently seen as out of scope of this document.


# Security Considerations

TODO Security.


# IANA Considerations

We will need to register:
- the TLS keying material exporter label "EXPORTER-masque" (spec required)
https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#exporter-labels
- the new HTTP header "Masque-Authentication"
https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml
- the "/.well-known/masque/" URI (expert review)
https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml
- The "masque" and "masque-udp-proxy" extended HTTP CONNECT protocols
We will also need to define the MASQUE control protocol and that will be
likely to define new registries of their own.

# Other Notes
{:numbered="false"}

This proposal is inspired directly or indirectly by prior work from many
people. In particular, this work is related to draft-schwartz-httpbis-helium
and draft-pardue-httpbis-http-network-tunnelling. Some of the other
inspirations are listed below, apologies for anyone who was missed.

TLS post-handshake authentication is not used by this proposal because that
requires sending the "post_handshake_auth" extension in the TLS ClientHello,
and that would stick out from a regular HTTPS connection.

The current proposal would also work with TLS 1.2, but in that case TLS false
start and renegotiation must be disabled, and the extended master secret and
renegotiation indication TLS extensions must be enabled.

Using an exported key as a nonce allows us to prevent replay attacks (since it
depends on randomness from both endpoints of the TLS connection) without
requiring the server to send an explicit nonce before it has authenticated the
client. Adding an explicit nonce mechanism would expose the server as it would
need to send these nonces to clients that have not been authenticated yet.

The rationale for a separate MASQUE protocol stream is to allow
server-initiated messages. If we were to use HTTP, we would only be able to
support the client-initiated request-response model. We could have used
WebSocket for this purpose but that would have added wire overhead and
dependencies without providing useful features.

There are many other ways to authenticate HTTP, however the authentication
used here needs to work in a single client-initiated message to meet the
requirement of not exposing the server.

If the server or client want to hide that HTTP/2 is used, the client can set
its ALPN to an older version of HTTP and then use the Upgrade header to
upgrade to HTTP/2 inside the TLS encryption.

Using the OID for the signature algorithm was inspired by RFC 7427 -
Signature Authentication in IKEv2.

The client authentication used here is similar to how Token Binding operates,
but it has very different goals. MASQUE does not use token binding directly
because using token binding requires sending the token_binding TLS extension
in the TLS ClientHello, and that would stick out compared to a regular TLS
connection, especially now that Chrome is killing token binding.

MASQUE proposes a new client authentication method (as opposed to reusing
something like HTTP basic authentication) because HTTP authentication methods
are conceptually per-request (they need to be repeated on each request)
whereas the new method is bound to the underlying connection (be it QUIC or
TLS). In particular, this allows sending QUIC DATAGRAM frames without
authenticating every frame individually. Additionally, HMAC and asymmetric
keying are preferred to sending a password for client authentication since
they have a tighter security bound. Going into the design rationale, HMACs
(and signatures) need some data to sign, and to avoid replay attacks that
should be a fresh nonce provided by the remote peer. Having the server
provide an explicit nonce would leak the existence of the server so we use
TLS keying material exporters as they provide us with a nonce that contains
entropy from the server without requiring explicit communication.

Client authentication could have benefited from Secondary Certificate
Authentication in HTTP/2, however that has two downsides: it requires the
server advertising that it supports it in its SETTINGS, and it cannot be sent
unprompted by the client, so the server would have to request authentication.
Both of these would make the server stick out from regular HTTP/2 servers.

The mechanism used to run the MASQUE protocol over HTTP/2 streams was inspired
by draft-ietf-httpbis-h2-websockets.
