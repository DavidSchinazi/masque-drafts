Abstract

   This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate
   over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE is a framework that allows
   concurrently running multiple networking applications inside an
   HTTP/3 connection.  For example, MASQUE can allow a QUIC client to
   negotiate proxying capability with an HTTP/3 server, and subsequently
   make use of this functionality while concurrently processing HTTP/3
   requests and responses.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF
   mailing list masque@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which
   contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate
   over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE is a framework that allows
   concurrently running multiple networking applications inside an
   HTTP/3 connection (see [HTTP3]).  For example, MASQUE can allow a
   QUIC client to negotiate proxying capability with an HTTP/3 server,
   and subsequently make use of this functionality while concurrently
   processing HTTP/3 requests and responses.

   MASQUE Negotiation is performed using HTTP mechanisms, but MASQUE
   applications can subsequently leverage QUIC [QUIC] features without
   using HTTP.

   Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF
   mailing list masque@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which
   contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  MASQUE Negotiation

   In order to negotiate the use of the MASQUE protocol, the client
   starts by sending a MASQUE request in the HTTP data of an HTTP POST
   request to "/.well-known/masque/initial".  The client can use this to
   request specific MASQUE applications and advertise support for MASQUE
   extensions.  The MASQUE server indicates support for MASQUE by
   sending an HTTP status code 200 response, and can use the data to
   inform the client of which MASQUE applications are now in use, and
   various configuration parameters.

   Both the MASQUE negotiation initial request and its response carry a
   sequence of MASQUE applications, as shown in Figure 1:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                 Figure 1: Sequence of MASQUE Applications

   Each MASQUE Application is encoded as an (identifier, length, value)
   tuple, as shown in Figure 2:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 MASQUE Application ID (i)                   ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 MASQUE Application Length (i)               ...

   |                 MASQUE Application Value (*)                ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 2: MASQUE Application Encoding

   The MASQUE Application Length field contains the length of the MASQUE
   Application Value field.  The contents of the MASQUE Application
   Value field are defined by its corresponding MASQUE application.
   When parsing, endpoints MUST ignore unknown MASQUE applications.  A
   given MASQUE application ID MUST NOT appear twice in a given sequence
   of MASQUE applications.

3.  MASQUE Applications

   When the MASQUE server accepts the client's MASQUE initial request,
   it advertises support for MASQUE Applications, which will be
   multiplexed over this HTTP/3 connection.

3.1.  HTTP Proxy

   The client can make proxied HTTP requests through the server to other
   servers.  In practice this will mean using the HTTP CONNECT method to
   establish a stream over which to run TLS to a different remote
   destination.  The proxy applies back-pressure to streams in both
   directions.

3.1.1.  HTTP Proxy Negotiation

   Use of the HTTP Proxying MASQUE application is negotiated by sending
   the http_proxying (type 0x00) type-length-value during MASQUE
   negotiation.  The length MUST be zero.

3.2.  DNS over HTTPS

   The client can send DNS queries using DNS over HTTPS [DOH] to the
   MASQUE server.

3.2.1.  DNS over HTTPS Negotiation

   Use of the DNS over HTTPS MASQUE application is negotiated by sending
   the dns_over_https (type 0x01) type-length-value during MASQUE
   negotiation.  When sent by the client, the length MUST be zero.  When
   sent by the server, the value contains the DoH URI Template encoded
   as a non-null-terminated UTF-8 string.

3.3.  QUIC Proxying

   By leveraging QUIC client connection IDs, a MASQUE server can act as
   a QUIC proxy while only using one UDP port.  To allow this, the
   MASQUE server informs the client of a required client connection ID
   length during negotiation.  The client is then able to send proxied
   packets to the MASQUE server who will forward them on to the desired
   IP address and UDP port.  Return packets are similarly forwarded in
   the opposite direction.

   Compared to UDP proxying, this mode has the advantage of only
   requiring one UDP port to be open on the MASQUE server, and can lower
   the overhead on the link between client and MASQUE server by
   compressing connection IDs.

3.3.1.  QUIC Proxy Compression

   To reduce the overhead of proxying, QUIC Proxying leverages
   compression to elide the connection IDs on the link between the
   client and MASQUE server.  This uses the concept of a compression
   context.  Compression contexts are indexed using a datagram flow
   identifiers [H3DGRAM], and contain the tuple (client connection ID,
   server connection ID, server IP address, server port).

   Any time and endpoint wants to send a proxied packet to its peer, it
   searches its list of compression contexts looking for one that
   matches the address, port and connection IDs from the proxied packet.
   If there was no match, the endpoint creates a new compression context
   and adds it to the list.

   Compression contexts also carry a boolean value representing whether
   the context has been validated, which means that this endpoint is
   confident that its peer is aware if the given compression context.
   Compression contexts that were created by the peer start off
   validated, whereas locally-created ones are not validated until the
   endpoint receives a packet using that compression context, or an
   acknowledgement for a sent packet that uses the context.

   The DATAGRAM frame [DGRAM] format below allows both endpoints to
   immediately start sending proxied QUIC packets using unvalidated
   compression contexts.  Once contexts are vaidated, the server IP
   address, server port and the connection IDs can be ommited.

   TODO: garbage collect obsolete compression contexts.

3.3.2.  QUIC Proxy Negotiation

   Use of the QUIC Proxying MASQUE application is negotiated by sending
   the quic_proxying (type 0x02) type-length-value during MASQUE
   negotiation.

   When sent by the client, the value contains a single variable-length
   integer, called new_quic_proxy_compression_context_flow_id, that
   represents the DATAGRAM flow ID used to negotiate compression
   contexts.

   When sent by the server, the value contains two variable-length
   integers, the DATAGRAM flow ID used to negotiate compression contexts
   (called new_quic_proxy_compression_context_flow_id), followed by the
   required connection ID length.

3.3.3.  QUIC Proxy Encoding

   Once negotiated, the QUIC Proxying MASQUE Application only uses
   DATAGRAM frames, whose content is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

   Validated QUIC Proxy DATAGRAM frames contain the following fields:

   Flow Identifier:  The flow identifier represents the compression
      context used by this frame.  Validated compression contexts MUST
      NOT use the new_quic_proxy_compression_context_flow_id value
      received during negotiation.

   Byte 1:  The first byte of the QUIC packet being transferred.

      bit of the Byte 1 field is set.

   QUIC Payload:  The contents of the QUIC packet being transmitted,
      starting after the last byte of last connection ID field.

3.3.4.  QUIC Proxy Routing

   A MASQUE server keeps a mapping from client connection IDs to MASQUE
   clients, so that it can correctly route return packets.  When a
   MASQUE server receives a QUIC Proxy DATAGRAM frame, it forwards it to
   the IP address and UDP port from the corresponding compression
   context.  Additionally, the MASQUE server will ensure that the client
   connection ID from that compression context maps to that MASQUE
   client.

   TODO: garbage collect this mapping from client connection ID to
   MASQUE client.

3.4.  UDP Proxying

   In order to support WebRTC to further servers, clients need a way to
   relay UDP onwards to a remote server.  In practice for most widely
   deployed protocols other than DNS, this involves many datagrams over
   the same ports.  Therefore this mechanism can compress the server's
   IP address and UDP port to reduce overhead.

3.4.1.  UDP Proxy Compression

   UDP Proxy leverages compression similarly to QUIC proxying, except
   that it only compresses the IP address and port, not QUIC connection
   IDs.

3.4.2.  UDP Proxy Negotiation

   Use of the UDP Proxying MASQUE application is negotiated by sending
   the udp_proxying (type 0x03) type-length-value during MASQUE
   negotiation.

   The value contains a single variable-length integer, called
   new_udp_proxy_compression_context_flow_id, that represents the
   DATAGRAM flow ID used to negotiate compression contexts.

3.4.3.  UDP Proxy Encoding

   Once negotiated, the UDP Proxying MASQUE Application only uses
   DATAGRAM frames, whose content is shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

   Unvalidated UDP Proxy DATAGRAM frames contain the following fields:

   Flow Identifier:  The flow identifier represents the compression
      context used by this frame.  Unvalidated compression contexts use
      the new_udp_proxy_compression_context_flow_id value received
      during negotiation.

   New Compression Context ID:  The new Compression Context ID that this
      frame uses.  The server IP address family, address, and port are
      associated with this context.

   Server Port Number:  The UDP port number used by the server.

   Family:  The IP address family of the Server IP Address field.  Can
      be either 4 or 6.

   Server IP Address:  The IP address of the server.  This field is 32
      bits long if Family is 4 and 128 bits long if Family is 6.

   UDP Payload:  The contents of the UDP packet being transmitted,
      starting after the last byte of the UDP checksum field.

      context used by this frame.  Validated compression contexts MUST
      NOT use the new_udp_proxy_compression_context_flow_id value
      received during negotiation.

   UDP Payload:  The contents of the UDP packet being transmitted,
      starting after the last byte of the UDP checksum field.

3.5.  IP Proxying

   For the rare cases where the previous mechanisms are not sufficient,
   proxying can be performed at the IP layer.  This would use a
   different DATAGRAM_ID and IP datagrams would be encoded inside it
   without framing.

3.5.1.  IP Proxy Negotiation

   Use of the IP Proxying MASQUE application is negotiated by sending
   the ip_proxying (type 0x04) type-length-value during MASQUE
   negotiation.

   The value contains a single variable-length integer, called
   ip_proxy_flow_id, that represents the DATAGRAM flow ID used by IP
   Proxying DATAGRAM frames.

3.5.2.  IP Proxy Encoding

   Once negotiated, the IP Proxying MASQUE Application only uses
   DATAGRAM frames, whose content is shown in Figure 7.

                        Figure 7: IP Proxy Datagram

   IP Proxy DATAGRAM frames contain the following fields:

   Flow Identifier:  The flow identifier MUST be set to the
      ip_proxy_flow_id value received during negotiation.

   IP Packet:  The full IP packet, starting from the IP Version field.

3.6.  Service Registration

   MASQUE can be used to make a home server accessible on the wide area.
   The home server authenticates to the MASQUE server and registers a
   domain name it wishes to serve.  The MASQUE server can then forward
   any traffic it receives for that domain name (by inspecting the TLS
   Server Name Indication (SNI) extension) to the home server.  This
   received traffic is not authenticated and it allows non-modified
   clients to communicate with the home server without knowing it is not
   colocated with the MASQUE server.

   To help obfuscate the home server, deployments can use Encrypted
   Server Name Indication [ESNI].  That will require the MASQUE server
   sending the cleartext SNI to the home server.

   TODO: define the wire format for Service Registration.

4.  Security Considerations

   Here be dragons.  TODO: slay the dragons.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  MASQUE Well-Known URI

   This document will request IANA to register the "/.well-known/
   masque/" URI (expert review) https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-
   known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml (https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml).

5.2.  MASQUE Applications Registry

   This document will request IANA to create a new MASQUE Applications
   registry which governs a 62-bit space of MASQUE application types.
   This registry follows the same registration policy as the QUIC
   Transport Parameter Registry; see the IANA Considerations section of
   [QUIC].

   The initial contents of this registry are shown in Table 1:

                +=======+================+===============+
                | Value | Parameter Name | Specification |
                +=======+================+===============+
                | 0x00  | http_proxying  | Section 3.1   |
                +-------+----------------+---------------+
                | 0x01  | dns_over_https | Section 3.2   |
                +-------+----------------+---------------+
                | 0x02  | quic_proxying  | Section 3.3   |
                +-------+----------------+---------------+
                | 0x03  | udp_proxying   | Section 3.4   |
                +-------+----------------+---------------+
                | 0x04  | ip_proxying    | Section 3.5   |
                +-------+----------------+---------------+
