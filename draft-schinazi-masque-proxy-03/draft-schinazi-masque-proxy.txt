                   draft-schinazi-masque-proxy-latest

Abstract

   MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption) is a
   set of protocols and extensions to HTTP that allow proxying all kinds
   of Internet traffic over HTTP.  This document defines the concept of
   a "MASQUE Proxy", an Internet-accessible node that can relay client
   traffic in order to provide privacy guarantees.

1.  Introduction

   In the early days of HTTP, requests and responses weren't encrypted.
   In order to add features such as caching, HTTP proxies were developed
   to parse HTTP requests from clients and forward them on to other HTTP
   servers.  As SSL/TLS became more common, the CONNECT method was
   introduced [CONNECT] to allow proxying SSL/TLS over HTTP.  That gave
   HTTP the ability to create tunnels that allow proxying any TCP-based
   protocol.  While non-TCP-based protocols were always prevalent on the
   Internet, the large-scale deployment of QUIC [QUIC] meant that TCP no
   longer represented the majority of Internet traffic.  Simultaneously,
   the creation of HTTP/3 [HTTP/3] allowed running HTTP over a non-TCP-
   based protocol.  In particular, QUIC allows disabling loss recovery
   [DGRAM] and that can then be used in HTTP [HTTP-DGRAM].  This
   confluence of events created both the possibility and the necessity
   for new proxying technologies in HTTP.

   This led to the creation of MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate
   over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE allows proxying both UDP
   ([CONNECT-UDP]) and IP ([CONNECT-IP]) over HTTP.  While MASQUE has
   uses beyond improving user privacy, its focus and design are best
   suited for protecting sensitive information.

2.  Privacy Protections

   There are currently multiple usage scenarios that can benefit from
   using a MASQUE Proxy.

2.1.  Protection from Web Servers

   Connecting directly to Web servers allows them to access the public
   IP address of the user.  There are many privacy concerns relating to
   user IP addresses [IP-PRIVACY].  Because of these, many user agents
   would rather not establish a direct connection to web servers.  They
   can do that by running their traffic through a MASQUE Proxy.  The web
   server will only see the IP address of the MASQUE Proxy, not that of
   the client.

2.2.  Protection from Network Providers

   Some users may wish to obfuscate the destination of their network
   traffic from their network provider.  This prevents network providers
   from using data harvested from this network traffic in ways the user
   did not intend.

2.3.  Partitioning

   While routing traffic through a MASQUE proxy reduces the network
   provider's ability to observe traffic, that information is transfered
   to the proxy operator.  This can be suitable for some threat models,
   but for the majority of users transferring trust from their network
   provider to their proxy (or VPN) provider is not a meaningful
   security improvement.

   There is a technical solution that allows resolving this issue: it is
   possible to nest MASQUE tunnels such that traffic flows through
   multiple MASQUE proxies.  This has the advantage of partitioning
   sensitive information to prevent correlation [PARTITION].

   Though the idea of nested tunnels dates back decades [TODO], MASQUE
   now allows running HTTP/3 end-to-end from a user agent to an origin
   via multiple nested CONNECT-UDP tunnels.  The proxy closest to the
   user can see the user's IP address but not the origin, whereas the
   other proxy can see the origin without knowing the user's IP address.
   If the two proxies are operated by non-colluding entities, this
   allows hiding the user's IP address from the origin without the
   proxies knowing the user's browsing history.

2.4.  Obfuscation

   The fact that MASQUE is layered over HTTP makes it much more
   resilient to detection.  To network observers, the unencrypted bits
   in a QUIC connection used for MASQUE are indistinguishable from those
   of a regular Web browsing connection.  Separately, if paired with a
   non-probeable HTTP authentication scheme [SIGNATURE-AUTH], any Web
   server can also become a MASQUE proxy while remaining
   indistinguishable from a regular Web server.  It might still be
   possible to detect some level of MASQUE usage by analyzing encrypted
   traffic patterns, however the cost of performing such an analysis at
   scale makes it impractical.

   This allows MASQUE to operate on networks that disallow VPNs by using
   a combination of protocol detection and blocklists.

3.  Related Technologies

   This section discusses how MASQUE fits in with other contemporary
   privacy-focused IETF protocols.

3.1.  OHTTP

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] uses a cryptographic primitive [HPKE] that is
   more lightweight than TLS [TLS], making it a great fit for
   decorrelating HTTP requests.  In traditional Web browsing, the user
   agent will often make many requests to the same origin (e.g., to load
   HTML, style sheets, images, scripts) and those requests are
   correlatable since the origin can include identifying query
   parameters to join separate requests.  In such scenarios, MASQUE is a
   better fit since it operates at the granularity of a connection.
   However, there are scenarios where a user agent might want to make
   non-correlatable requests (e.g., to anonymously report telemetry);
   for those, OHTTP provides better efficiency than using MASQUE with a
   separate connection per request.  While OHTTP and MASQUE are separate
   technologies that serve different use cases, they can be colocated on
   the same HTTP server that acts as both a MASQUE Proxy and an OHTTP
   Relay.

3.2.  DoH

   DNS over HTTPS [DoH] allows encrypting DNS traffic by sending it
   through an encrypted HTTP connection.  Colocating a DoH server with a
   MASQUE IP proxy provides better performance than using DNS over port
   53 inside the encrypted tunnel.

4.  Security Considerations

   Implementers of a MASQUE proxy need to review the Security
   Considerations of the documents referenced by this one.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
